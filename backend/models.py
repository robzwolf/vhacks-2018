# What is this?
`models.py` is a file that describes all CRUD (create, read, update, destroy) operations possible when interfacing with the database, which is itself specified in `reviews.db`. In particular, `models.py` dictates what happens when one wants to add a review, upvote a review, or downvote a review (TODO).
